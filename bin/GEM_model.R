#' GEM_Gmodel Analysis

#' GEM_Gmodel creates a methQTL genome-wide map.
#'
#' GEM_Gmodel creates a methQTL genome-wide map by performing matrix based iterative correlation and memory-efficient 
#' data analysis instead of millions of linear regressions (N = number_of_CpGs x number_of_SNPs)
#' between methylation and genotyping. Polymorphisms close to CpGs in the same chromosome (cis-) or different chromosome (trans-)
#' often form methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTLs) with CpGs. In GEM_Gmodel, MethQTLs can be discovered by correlating
#' single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with CpG methylation from the same samples, by linear regression lm (M ~ G + covt),
#' where M is a matrix with methylation data, G is a matrix with genotype data and covt is a matrix with covariates,
#' and all read from the formatted text data file. The methylation data are the measurements for CpG probes, for example,
#' 450,000 CpGs from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array. The genotype data are encoded as 1,2,3 or any three 
#' distinct values for major allele homozygote (AA),
#' heterozygote (AB) and minor allele homozygote (BB). The linear regression is adjusted by covariates read from covariate data file.
#' The output of GEM_Gmodel is a list of CpG-SNP pairs, where the SNP is the best fit to explain the particular CpG. The significant
#' association between CpG-SNP pair suggests the methylation driven by genotyping variants, which is so called methylation quantitative
#' trait loci (methQTL).

#' GEM_GxEmodel
#'
#' GEM_GxEmodel tests the ability of the interaction of gene and environmental factor to predict DNA methylation level.
#'
#' GEM_GxEmodel explores how the genotype can work in interaction with environment (GxE) to influence specific DNA 
#' methylation level, by performing matrix based iterative correlation and memory-efficient data analysis 
#' among methylation, genotyping and environment. 
#' This has greatly released the computational burden for GxE study from billions of linear
#' regression (N = number_of_CpGs x number_of_SNPs x number_of_environment) and made it possible to be accomplished in an 
#' efficient way.
#' The linear regression is lm (M ~ G x E + covt), where M is a matrix with methylation data, G is a matrix with genotype data,
#' E is environment data and covt is covariate matrix. E values is combined into covariate file as the last row, and all read from the formatted text data file. The output of
#' GEM_GxEmodel is a list of CpG-SNP-Env triplets, where the environment factor segregated in genotype group fits to explain
#' the particular CpG. The significant association suggests the association between methylation and environment can be better
#' explained by segregation in genotype groups (GxE).
